# T4G-Template
This is a GitHub repository intended to act as a template for an open source assistive technology device. It is meant to contain all design files, build files, and documentation for the project. 
<!--- TITLE --->
<!--- Open Source Assistive Technology: GitHub Readme Template --->


<!--- INSTRUCTIONS --->
<!--- This is a markdown template for creating the README.md file in a GitHub repository. This file is rendered and displayed automatically when someone visits the repository.

This document includes helper text that will not be displayed when rendered. Any text between the less-than sign + exclamation mark + three hyphen-minus (<!---) and matching three hyphen-minus + greater-than sign will not be displayed. This helper text can be deleted once the corresponding section is completed.

This template has a number of fields that can be searched and replaced with other text:
 - <Device_Name> Replace this with filename-friendly version of the device with underscores. e.g., T4G-Adapted-Recorder-Button
 - <DeviceName> Replace this with the human-readable name of the device with spaces. e.g., Adapted RecorderButton
 - <DesignerName> Replace this with the person or organization responsible for the design. e.g., John Doe.
 - <Repository_Link> Replace this with the web address for the repository. e.g., (e.g., https://github.com/Engineering-Good/T4G-Adapted-Recorder-Button))
 - <MaterialCost> Replace this with the dollar cost and currency (SGD, USD, etc.) of the materials of the device.
 - <ShippingCost> Replace this with the dollar cost and currency (SGD, USD, etc.) of shipping the device (if possible).
 - <YEAR> year(s) of the copyright
 
Any text that is currently holding a space / is an instruction for the person filling in the README is in all capitals, to make it easier to see them in a rendered version.
